**January 2022 - November 2024**  
**Irkutsk, Russia**  

- As an International Business Manager for IE Krylepove, a private agronomist specializing in agricultural fertilizers, I managed all aspects of international logistics and business development. My responsibilities included overseeing the exportation of agricultural fertilizers, negotiating and closing high-value deals, and conducting strategic meetings with potential investors and buyers to promote our products.
- Key Achievements:
Successfully facilitated the export of agricultural fertilizers to international markets, optimizing supply chain efficiency and ensuring compliance with international trade regulations.
Spearheaded the negotiation and formalization of a partnership agreement between IE Krylepove, Irkutsk Agrarian University, and Eagles Afrique (a university in Ghana). This collaboration focused on agricultural research and the exchange of students, fostering innovation and knowledge-sharing in the field of agriculture.
Enhanced client acquisition through persuasive communication and tailored presentations, contributing to a significant increase in sales revenue.


### FIELD ENGINEER  
**Volta River Authority (Loss Control Department)**  
_Techiman, Bono Region_  
_October 2021 â€“ September 2022_ 

- During my tenure at the Volta River Authority (Loss Control Department), I supported the organizationâ€™s mission to deliver reliable and environmentally sustainable energy across Ghana and West Africa by applying technical expertise in power distribution and network optimization. I actively participated in preventive maintenance protocols, implementing strategic measures that resulted in an 85% reduction in unauthorized electrical connections and a substantial improvement in network efficiency in the Bono region. My role involved collaboration with field engineers to conduct transformer installations, enhancing load distribution and voltage regulation within the local grid. Additionally, I performed diagnostic assessments to identify system inefficiencies, contributing to the overall stability and resilience of the grid infrastructure, aligned with VRAâ€™s standards for safe and efficient energy supply.

### RENEWABLE ENERGY ENGINEER  
**Nature Farms**  
_Accra, Greater Accra Region_  
_June 2019 â€“ December 2021_ 

- I design solar inverter systems specifically for agricultural irrigation, enabling farmers to reduce their reliance on traditional energy sources and boost productivity. I also handle the comprehensive sizing and implementation of solar panel systems for household energy needs, covering every aspect of the projectâ€”from initial conceptualization and work planning to detailed design and execution. I develop APIs to monitor and track the efficiency of solar panels, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for both agricultural and residential applications

## Projects
### DESIGN OF HYBRID SYSTEM (MINI HYDRO / SOLAR PV)
[Publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G5AEj21FFzW8PeilqseuXR209UR3Lkgc/view?usp=sharing)

This project focused on designing a hybrid solar-hydro power plant to address the energy needs of the Alavanyo Abenehenase community in the Hohoe Municipality of Ghana's Volta Region. The integration of a solar power system with the existing Bui Power Authority micro-hydro plant, the study aimed to maximize energy capacity and provide a reliable and continuous power supply for the community.
The study collected site-specific data revealing a hydro potential of 769 kW and peak sun hours of 5.1 with an irradiance of 1791.1 kWh/mÂ², demonstrating the feasibility of the hybrid system. The results showed that the hybrid system's maximum output could meet the Hohoe municipality's electrical load demand.

### MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT PRODUCT DEMAND
[Publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BtmNVFO6YwHLN08x6nmzq9Mld5Tc8Ze7/view?usp=sharing)

The subject of the research is to develop a web application interface based on the best model identified through the comparative study, for predicting product demand.
Purpose of work is to contribute to the enhancement of forecasting future trends over time and offers valuable guidance to data experts, analysts, and researchers on selecting the most suitable method for making accurate and reliable predictions in various situations. 
The RESEARCH provides ,  the design framework of the web application interface, implementation of the models in python and results comparison, model deployment, data handling procedures and how to use the deployed model.
The result of the work is to use machine learning and the developed web application interface to predict product demand.
